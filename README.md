# Sentiment_Anomaly_Identification
I Implemented dynamic z-score thresholding algorithm to detect anomalous social media negative sentiment spikes using R. At heart, it is a dynamic peak detection algorithm based on the principle of dispersion: if a given data-point (a celebrities negative social media sentiment volume) is x number of standard deviations away from a thirty day moving mean, the algorithm signals - indicating a peak in negative sentiment. This algorithm constructs a separate moving mean and deviation for each 30 day period, such that the signals do not corrupt the z-score threshold. It was crucial to have a moving mean and dynamic z-score for determining signals because we had to adapt for celebrities of varying social media following (i.e. the more popular a celebrity was, the higher the volume of 'noise' unimportant comments.)
